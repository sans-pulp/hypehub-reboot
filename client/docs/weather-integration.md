# Weather Integration Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Integration
Essential weather features that integrate with existing systems.

### Location Services
- Implement browser geolocation
- Handle location permissions
- Basic error handling for denied permissions

### Basic Weather Integration
- OpenMeteo API integration
- Core weather data fetching:
  - Current temperature and conditions
  - Basic daily forecast
  - Weather codes for conditions
- Simple caching mechanism

### Initial UI Components
- Weather display in dashboard
- Basic weather icons
- Simple weather alerts
- Outdoor/indoor goal classification

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features
Building upon core functionality with more complex integrations.

### Weather-Goal System
- Weather metadata for goals
- Basic weather condition checks
- Simple alternative suggestions
- Weather-based warnings

### Dashboard Enhancements
- 3-day forecast preview
- Time-of-day UI themes
- Weather alerts for scheduled goals
- Basic weather-based recommendations

### Technical Improvements
- Improved client-side caching
- Offline mode handling
- Mobile-responsive weather displays
- Performance optimizations

## Future Enhancements
Features requiring significant additional infrastructure.

### Advanced Weather Systems
- Weather-based achievement tracking
- Dynamic difficulty adjustments
- Complex scheduling algorithms
- Historical weather data analysis

### Game Mechanics Integration
- Weather condition profiles
- Weather-based character buffs
- Seasonal event systems
- Advanced achievement chains

## Technical Considerations

### API Parameters
```typescript
current: [
  'temperature_2m',
  'apparent_temperature',
  'weathercode',
  'is_day'
]

daily: [
  'weathercode',
  'temperature_2m_max',
  'temperature_2m_min',
  'precipitation_probability_max'
]

hourly: [
  'temperature_2m',
  'precipitation_probability',
  'weathercode'
]
```

### Security & Privacy
- Location data handling
- User consent management
- Data retention policies
- API key security

### Performance
- Minimize API calls
- Efficient data caching
- Optimize weather calculations
- Reduce bundle size
